# Easystroke Gesture Recognition Software for X11

This is a fork of `https://github.com/akozlins/easystroke`, which is a fork of the original Easystroke Project that is completely unmaintained, at this point... The purpose of my fork is to integrate all 
(good) changes found in other forks that are useful and/or fix bugs. 

akozlins has made a few great changes, as listed below:

- use cmake to build project
- use `valac` to compile `cellrenderertextish.vala`
- save preferences in xml format

The original repo/project can be found here: https://github.com/thjaeger/easystroke
