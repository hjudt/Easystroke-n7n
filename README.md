# Easystroke Gesture Recognition Software for X11

This is a fork of `https://github.com/akozlins/easystroke`. The original Easystroke Project that is completely unmaintained, at this point... Akozlins' fork adds cmake build system, some vala changes + a couple of fixes... 

The purpose of my fork is a continued effort to integrate useful changes && bugfixes found in other forks, while retaining
the original look, feel and spirit of the original Easystroke software. The other motivation is that the Archlinux AUR packages
are poorly maintained and are currently broken (so I might as well just maintain my own packages).

I'm also pulling and adapting changes from the Easy-Gesture Fork(s) found here;
